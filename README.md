# Plejd

This app allows you to control your Plejd devices directly from Homey, no extra gateway is needed.
It uses an unsupported method for communication using bluetooth.

Supported features:
- Toggle state on/off/dim
- Instant state change
- Syncing Plejd internal clock
- Plejd buttons (single click only)

With big thanks to [Smartprofy](https://smartprofy.nl) testing this code with their Plejd products!

## Thanks
Big thanks to [@klali](https://github.com/klali) and his https://github.com/klali/ha-plejd component for Home assistant, this project would not have been possible without it.

And another big thank to Jonas Almquist and every contributor for your donations that got me a Homey!
